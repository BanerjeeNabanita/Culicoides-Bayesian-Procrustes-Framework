README: Bayesian Procrustes Analysis of Sexual Dimorphism in Wing Shape

This R script performs a Bayesian Procrustes analysis to study sexual dimorphism in 2D wing landmark data of Culicoides species. It compares male and female datasets, estimates Procrustes variance, and visualizes posterior distributions to examine shape variation between sexes. The analysis uses our R package, \textbf{BPviGM1} (“Bayesian Procrustes Variance-based Inferences in Geometric Morphometrics 1”), which provides all functions required for transparent and reproducible Bayesian inference in geometric morphometrics (refer to the Appendix of the paper for implementation details). The workflow includes reading and preprocessing 2D wing landmark data, performing Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) to align landmarks and remove non-shape variation, running Bayesian MCMC sampling to estimate posterior distributions of Procrustes variance for each sex, and generating density plots to compare male and female shape variance. Before running the script, update all file paths and dataset names according to your directory, and modify sample sizes, iteration numbers, or priors if necessary. Ensure the following R packages are installed: Shapes, Morpho, BPviGM1, Scales, and readxl. The output includes posterior variance estimates for males and females, density plots comparing posterior distributions of Procrustes variance, and Procrustes-aligned landmark datasets for reproducibility. If you use this script or the BPviGM1 package, please cite the publication describing the Bayesian framework for Procrustes variance-based inference in geometric morphometrics.
